# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using FlatList in React Native to render data fetched from an API.  The FlatList fails to display the data correctly, despite the loading and error states working as expected.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.

## Problem

The initial implementation fetches data successfully, but the FlatList remains blank, even though the data is available in the component's state. This is a subtle issue often caused by incorrect handling of the data or improper state management.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the data being passed to the `FlatList` component is correctly formatted and accessible. In this instance, we correct the error handling and data processing for proper display.
